# Personal Portfolio :: Eliza - Teodora Doltu

## Welcome!

Hello! I'm **Eliza-Teodora Doltu**, a student at **"Alexandru-Ioan Cuza" University** in Ia»ôi, Romania, specializing in front-end development and web design.

I'm passionate about blending technology and art to create beautiful and functional user experiences. Every project is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm constantly striving to improve my skills.

I believe that every website has a unique story to tell, and I'm dedicated to crafting designs that accurately portray that narrative. Storytelling through design is what excites me the most. Whether it's a simple landing page or a complex web application, I'm committed to creating experiences that are both visually appealing and user-friendly.

This portfolio showcases my design journey and some of the projects I've worked on. Feel free to take a look around and get in touch if you have any questions!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
